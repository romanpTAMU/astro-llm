We will see more coupons, more incentives, and more gimmicks than we've ever seen before. So I'm concerned about the margins at the end of December and more importantly, at the end of January when most of these retailers close their books.\" She attributes the increased competition among retailers to tariffs which have raised prices on some items and may leave retailers with more inventory than desired.While shoppers hunt for the best deals, they are also relying more on AI to help them find them and are also using \"buy now, pay later\" services which hit an all-time high on Cyber Monday.Even though some consumers took on short-term debt while shopping for gifts this year, analysts noted that shoppers remained savvy and watched price tags carefully to avoid impulse buys.",
