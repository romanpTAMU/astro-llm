And every country needs to find that balance and President Trump has found his balance and he encourages us to go back to China with H200 and extend NVIDIA's, extend America's technology leadership and AI leadership.\"Neither ByteDance nor the Commerce Department immediately responded to a request for comment.Beijing has already given preliminary approval for some major tech firms to import the chips.:: FileOne source says at least a few U.S. shipments could move ahead before Donald Trump’s expected meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in April.",
