THIS VERSION HAS BEEN AMENDED TO REFLECT THE CORRECT FIGURE.Nike shares climbed about 5.5% in Wednesday morning trading after Apple CEO Tim Cook doubled his personal stake in the sportswear giant.That's according to a regulatory filing.Cook sits on Nike's board and now owns about $6 million worth of stock.The purchase appears to be a vote of confidence in the turnaround efforts of Nike CEO Elliot Hill.It comes days after the company reported weaker quarterly margins and weak sales in China.That's despite Hill's attempt to lift demand with fresh marketing plans and innovation focused on running and sports while phasing out lagging lifestyle brands.The CEO has also tried to mend ties with wholesalers like Dick's Sporting Goods... to try and put the brand in front of shoppers as competition heats up with rivals.However, Hill's plan is putting strain on Nike's margins, now in decline for over a year, and its efforts to get back on top in China are faltering.Nike's shares have slumped nearly 13% since it reported results on December 18 and are on track for the fourth straight year of declines.",
