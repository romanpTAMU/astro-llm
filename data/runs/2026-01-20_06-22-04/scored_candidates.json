However, analysts suggest that the market may be overlooking potential catalysts, including new product launches and a focus on cash generation and inventory management, which could position the company for a rebound by late 2026. The shift towards lease and subscription models in the residential solar-and-storage market may also benefit Enphase as it adapts to changing consumer preferences. Overall, while the stock has dipped, operational discipline and strategic focus could enhance its long-term growth prospects.",
