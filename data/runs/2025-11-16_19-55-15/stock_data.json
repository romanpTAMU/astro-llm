We want enough hours to meet the benefits. We want enough staffing in our stores so we're not overworked. And we want to be paid enough to live in this city.\"The walkout coincides with Red Cup Day, a busy sales event that typically drives higher customer visits.The union warned the strike could become the largest and longest in the history of Starbucks.So far, there has been minimal impact with less than 1% of stores seeing any disruption.That's according to Starbucks, which told Reuters the union represents roughly 9,500 workers, or 4% of its cafe workforce.In April, the union voted to reject a Starbucks proposal that guaranteed annual raises of at least 2%, saying it did not offer changes to economic benefits such as healthcare, or an immediate pay hike.SHAO: \"And meanwhile, our CEO is making $96 million, and he... for only four months of work, and meanwhile our CEO is riding in a private jet, and I'm barely able to afford the MTA (New York transit system) fare to go to work.\"The union has filed more than 1,000 charges to the National Labor Relations Board for alleged unfair labor practices.Starbucks has said it pays an average wage of $19 an hour and offers employees who work at least 20 hours a week benefits including healthcare, parental leave and tuition for online classes at Arizona State University.The union has said starting wages are $15.25 per hour in about 33 states and the average barista gets less than 20 hours per week.Both sides have blamed the other for stalling the talks, and say they are ready to return to the bargaining table.",
