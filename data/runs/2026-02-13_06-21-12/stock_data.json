And it's not just software that was a big cause recently of all the tech volatility. We are seeing it today show up in office commercial real estate. We saw it earlier this week in wealth management firms. So any news that may cause any disruptions in any sector is causing immediate sell-off, regardless of whether or not it actually will have any material impact in any of these companies that are selling off.”Shares of Applovin were the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 software index, tumbling more than 19%, despite beating market estimates for fourth-quarter sales.

Brokerage Jefferies said in a note that she wasn't \"on many shortlists as potential successor.\"Hudson, pushed out just two months before a potential contract renewal, had been tasked with reviving the company's drug pipeline and share price.But he has struggled to reduce dependence on the company's blockbuster asthma drug Dupixent,which loses key patents in the early 2030s, and the turnaround stalled.Sanofi has also faced rising pressure on its key vaccine business, especially in the US.In January the company said that vaccine sales would be \"slightly negative\" this year, partly due to U.S. policy changes under President Donald Trump.Hudson's departure marks the latest in a recent string of European pharmaceutical CEO exits after new leadership at UK-based GSK in January and Danish weight-loss drugmaker Novo Nordisk last August.",
