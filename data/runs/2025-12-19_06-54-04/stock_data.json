This is the busy time of the season for returns.\":: Nearly one in 10 retail returns for a refund in the U.S. is fraudulent, a $76.5 billion problem“Right now, retailers are under a tremendous amount of pressure, pressure from a cost perspective and pressure from a return fraud perspective. And so those are two areas that we're really trying to help them alleviate.\"“So returns are dropped off every day without a box and label at our Return Bar network across the nation. Those returns are aggregated across brands and shipped to one of these facilities.\"“We have an algorithm that uses machine learning to score every return for its potential risk. We then take those that have been identified as high risk and we audit them using pictures. So we take pictures of each item, and artificial intelligence helps us compare those pictures to the images in a merchant's product catalog as…Think about that as sort of an extra level of safety, because sometimes humans don't always catch small differentiation points between an item that's been returned and the item that was purchased.”Nearly one in every 10 retail items that are returned for a refund in the United States is fraudulent, a $76.5 billion problem for the country’s retailers that a unit of delivery giant UPS says it plans to combat with artificial intelligence. This holiday season, UPS-owned boxless returns processing company Happy Returns is testing its AI fraud detection tool with a handful of clients including apparel sellers Everlane, Revolve, and Under Armour, Happy Returns CEO David Sobie told Reuters during a recent tour of the company's Los Angeles-area hub.These retailers are among the many U.S. companies that have been hit by return fraud, a method of stealing in which a customer applies for a refund on a retail item and ships back something else of less value, like a cheap knock-off that cannot be resold.Happy Returns' AI tool called Return Vision helps to find fraudulent returns by flagging suspicious packages, analyzing their contents, and sending them for final audit by humans who can verify the fraud and withhold refund, Sobie said.Happy Returns specializes in no box and no label returns. Shoppers take unwanted items to so-called \"returns bars\" inside Ulta Beauty, Staples or UPS stores, where workers scan, bag, and label items that are then combined in large boxes and sent daily to processing hubs, saving retailers time and money. Shoppers - and fraudsters - like the service because it is easy and often offers immediate refunds.",
