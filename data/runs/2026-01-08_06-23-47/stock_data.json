So as we're driving, as we are testing, both on road and in simulations, it gets better and better at driving. So that means we can really quickly deploy it into new places, put it on new types of vehicles for logistics or for robotaxis or even maybe some day for personally owned vehicles. For Lucid, the robotaxi offers growth beyond regular electric cars for consumers. The company has been battling slower EV demand and mounting competition.It recently reported 2025 deliveries slightly above estimates, but production was much higher than sales.Lucid CEO Marc Winterhoff says the plan is to tap new markets.:: Marc Winterhoff, CEO of Lucid Group\"Before, we were focusing on B2C customers, you know, the regular cars for you and me, which we still do obviously. But now with that cooperation with Uber and others to come, we're now opening the robotaxi market for us. So it's more like expanding the application of our EV technology which has been proven in the last couple of years to be industry leading. And with that cooperation, now we have another market to serve.\"The partnership plan to launch robotaxi services in the San Francisco Bay Area later this year.",

So as we're driving, as we are testing, both on road and in simulations, it gets better and better at driving. So that means we can really quickly deploy it into new places, put it on new types of vehicles for logistics or for robotaxis or even maybe some day for personally owned vehicles. For Lucid, the robotaxi offers growth beyond regular electric cars for consumers. The company has been battling slower EV demand and mounting competition.It recently reported 2025 deliveries slightly above estimates, but production was much higher than sales.Lucid CEO Marc Winterhoff says the plan is to tap new markets.:: Marc Winterhoff, CEO of Lucid Group\"Before, we were focusing on B2C customers, you know, the regular cars for you and me, which we still do obviously. But now with that cooperation with Uber and others to come, we're now opening the robotaxi market for us. So it's more like expanding the application of our EV technology which has been proven in the last couple of years to be industry leading. And with that cooperation, now we have another market to serve.\"The partnership plan to launch robotaxi services in the San Francisco Bay Area later this year.",

Megadeals greater than $5 billion represented more than 75% of incremental deal value. Meanwhile, exit activity for private equity companies accelerated meaningfully in the third quarter of last year. Private equity firms announced exits totaling $470 billion in 2025 per the latest data from EY, marking a 40% increase by value compared with the same period last year. Sambur shares his outlook for M&A and exits in 2026, the drivers of that potential activity and what he has learned from making big deals over the course of his career.Disclosure: Yahoo is a portfolio company of funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management.",
