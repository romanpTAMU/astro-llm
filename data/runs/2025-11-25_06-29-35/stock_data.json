So we're expecting $2 billion worth of purchases to be made using that type of technology, which shows that consumers are still really excited to make purchases and get value out of the discounts that we're seeing. However, they're looking to figure out ways to make the most of their money and stretch it.”One analyst who tracks consumer pricing tells Reuters that knowing when the best prices will appear is hard to determine because retailers have started promotions so early this year that those deals may not be available for Black Friday or the items could be out of stock.",

          "summary": "STORY: Australian teenagers are set to lose their social media accounts, with a ban on young users set to kick in from December 10. Over the coming days, online platforms like TikTok, Snapchat, Meta and Instagram will notify more than a million teen account holders in the country. Users under the age of 16 must choose an option: Download data, freeze their profiles, or lose everything under the world-first ban on kids using social media.Based on information from insiders, the big platforms plan to deactivate accounts for users under the age of 16.Australia's other 20 million social media users should face no big changes.The move puts the nation out front in shielding young people from online risks.Earlier this year, platforms had warned of total chaos, fearing that they could lose users and face $32 million fines for breaking the rules.They said required age checks would mean constant logins, invade privacy and often be wrong or easy to dodge.But now, firms will use existing software that guesses ages from user habits, instead of asking for birth dates all the time.They will generally only push people to special age-check apps if someone complains about being blocked by mistake.The setup might hit snags at first.Age-check apps which are being deployed at scale for the first time can make mistakes.La Trobe University AI professor Daswin De Silva explains:\"One of the challenges with age verification also is this band between 15, 16, 17, how do you distinguish 15 from 16 to 17. So a lot of the technological methods of age verification will fail in that narrow band and there might be false positives where certain individuals who are over 16, slightly over 16 will be banned from these platforms because their content was classified as relevant to under an 16 sort of target demographic.\"\"It's probably going to be service distortion, service failure for a couple of days or weeks maybe until the platforms figure this out, and we'll see a lot of articles on media and maybe on social media itself of false positives.\"Meta, Snapchat, TikTok and Google declined to comment.The law states that such platforms must take \"reasonable steps\" to block minors.If the rollout goes smoothly, it could guide the world in cutting kids' exposure to harms like bullying or weight issues from screens.The UK and France added age gates for porn earlier this year. Then in November, Denmark said it would ban under-15s from social media.",
