Despite a recent mixed performance in share prices, with a 90-day decline of 6.15%, AMD has achieved a 73.63% total shareholder return over the past year. The introduction of the MI455 chip, touted as the most advanced yet, positions AMD as a key player in the competitive AI chip market, although it still trails behind Nvidia in market share.
