          "summary": "STORY: Carving silently across Lake Mead, a reservoir situated about 30 minutes southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, this boat offers a glimpse of a future where water sports leave nothing behind but a clean wake.The all-electric wake sport boat is part of its creators' bold bet that the marine world is ready to go electric.:: Carbon ShiftBuilt by California-based startup Arc and designed by a team of former Tesla and Rivian engineers, the 23-foot Arc Sport EV brings Silicon Valley to the water.Mitch Lee is the co-founder of Arc.:: Mitch Lee, Co-founder and CEO of Arc“It's a fully electric wake sport boat, 23 feet, 500 horsepower. It has a giant battery on board and it gives you hours of fun out on the water without any of the fumes, any of the of noise, any maintenance burdens of a gas boat.\"“On the water, the Arc Sport gives you an experience that is quieter, you don't have the fumes from a gas engine. It's more performant, you have so much more power and torque available to you. It's all software enabled, and it's actually cheaper to operate. More convenient to charge a boat overnight than it is to lug gas cans down to the dock. And then once you take it off of the water, you don't have the maintenance headaches, you don't need to winterize it.\"According to Lee, on a single charge, the boat can handle four to six hours of active use, with an overnight charge on a Level 2 charger delivering a full battery by morning.Beyond the powertrain, Arc leans heavily into software.“With one touch of a button, you can configure the balance system, the control surfaces, the cruise control for it, to throw that perfect surf wave on one side of the boat or the other.\"\"I think that electric boats make even more sense, that electric cars have pretty stiff competition in gas cars. Those gas cars are reliable, they're inexpensive, they are convenient, they are quiet, they've had a bunch of money put into R&D over the span of 100 years. Gas boats are not the same level of competition. And by going electric, you solve a bunch of very acute pain points with owning a gas boat.\"But Arc's technology comes at a premium.The Arc Sport EV boat starts at $268,000.Yet Lee says demand has not been an issue, with the wake sport boat being just the beginning.“We've already announced our next product that comes after this, which is a center console boat for fishing and leisure activities, and have also expanded into the commercial space as well. Larger vessels, harbor craft, you can think of tugboats and ferries, so taking that same technology and scaling it up to those applications.\"",

Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with SailGP CEO and storied yachtsman Russell Coutts. Coutts won an Olympic gold medal in 1984 and then went on to secure several America's Cup victories. In 2019, he co-founded SailGP with Oracle founder and billionaire Larry Ellison. Ellison is a longtime sailing fan. What once began as a fledgling sports league, has gained considerable momentum in terms of viewership and attracting new sponsors. The league now has 13 teams and celebrity team owners such as Hugh Jackman, Ryan Reynolds and Anne Hathaway. Team valuations have also continued to skyrocket, and the business is expected to produce $200 million in sales this year. Coutts shares what the 2026 sailing season holds and what it has been like, transitioning from an athlete to a CEO, piloting the future of a sports league.

          "summary": "STORY: Donald Trump's administration is planning to meet with executives from U.S. oil companies later this week.That's according to a Reuters source, who says the meetings are to discuss boosting Venezuelan oil production after U.S. forces ousted country leader Nicolas Maduro.The administration is eyeing getting U.S. oil companies back into the South American nation, after its government took control of U.S.-led energy operations there nearly two decades ago. The White House did not comment on the planned meetings.But said it believed U.S. industry was ready to move into Venezuela.The three biggest U.S. oil companies - Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron - did not immediately respond to requests for comment.According to four industry executives, the three firms have not yet had any conversations with the administration about Maduro's ouster.That contradicts Trump's statements over the weekend.The president said he had already held meetings with all the U.S. oil companies, both before and after Maduro was seized.Trump also said that he expects the firms to spend billions of dollars to boost Venezuela's oil production.But industry analysts say those plans will face challenges.They cite lack of infrastructure, and deep uncertainty over the country’s political future and legal framework, as well as doubts over long-term U.S. policy.",
