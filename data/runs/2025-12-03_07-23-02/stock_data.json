          "summary": "STORY: U.S. shoppers spent more than $44 billion online over the Thanksgiving weekend.That’s according to an Adobe Analytics report, which showed that spending rose 7.7% from a year earlier.But that was at a slightly slower pace than the 8.2% increase seen last year to $41 billion.Still, this year's online spending exceeded Adobe’s forecast.And online spending on Black Friday hit an all-time record.Consumers bought up everything from gadgets to household essentials during the five-days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday.Retailers including Amazon, Walmart and Target rolled out discounts across categories to draw both affluent shoppers eager to splurge and budget-conscious consumers looking to stretch every dollar.Those discounts could get better as the holiday period continues, says Marry Epner, an adjunct professor in the graduate program at Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.\"These retailers will get super competitive. We will see more coupons, more incentives, and more gimmicks than we've ever seen before. So I'm concerned about the margins at the end of December and more importantly, at the end of January when most of these retailers close their books.\" She attributes the increased competition among retailers to tariffs which have raised prices on some items and may leave retailers with more inventory than desired.While shoppers hunt for the best deals, they are also relying more on AI to help them find them and are also using \"buy now, pay later\" services which hit an all-time high on Cyber Monday.Even though some consumers took on short-term debt while shopping for gifts this year, analysts noted that shoppers remained savvy and watched price tags carefully to avoid impulse buys.",

We will see more coupons, more incentives, and more gimmicks than we've ever seen before. So I'm concerned about the margins at the end of December and more importantly, at the end of January when most of these retailers close their books.\" She attributes the increased competition among retailers to tariffs which have raised prices on some items and may leave retailers with more inventory than desired.While shoppers hunt for the best deals, they are also relying more on AI to help them find them and are also using \"buy now, pay later\" services which hit an all-time high on Cyber Monday.Even though some consumers took on short-term debt while shopping for gifts this year, analysts noted that shoppers remained savvy and watched price tags carefully to avoid impulse buys.",

If you recall, going back to the beginning of this year, there was a lot of inventory front-running ahead of the tariffs. There was kind of lower comps in terms of overall inflation. And there hasn't been a clear pass-through yet completely of all the sort of price rises that have happened as a result of the tariffs. So we do think that on the core goods part of the inflation basket, we do think that there's still some residual inflation catch up that has to happen. It probably takes place in the first few months of the year.\"Stocks on the move Tuesday included Boeing, which soared 10%, giving the Dow its biggest boost, after the planemaker forecast higher deliveries for its 737 and 787 jets next year.Bitcoin's rebound lifted crypto stocks, including Strategy, which gained nearly 6%.And shares of American Eagle jumped 15% in extended trading after the company raised its annual sales forecast, thanks in part to a controversial ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney.",

We will see more coupons, more incentives, and more gimmicks than we've ever seen before. So I'm concerned about the margins at the end of December and more importantly, at the end of January when most of these retailers close their books.\" She attributes the increased competition among retailers to tariffs which have raised prices on some items and may leave retailers with more inventory than desired.While shoppers hunt for the best deals, they are also relying more on AI to help them find them and are also using \"buy now, pay later\" services which hit an all-time high on Cyber Monday.Even though some consumers took on short-term debt while shopping for gifts this year, analysts noted that shoppers remained savvy and watched price tags carefully to avoid impulse buys.",
