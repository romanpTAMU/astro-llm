The company's management anticipates lower average selling prices and gross margins in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 due to affordability initiatives and market volatility. Additionally, Lennar's stock, along with other home builders, faced pressure following criticism from Bill Pulte regarding stock buybacks, contributing to a decline in share prices.
